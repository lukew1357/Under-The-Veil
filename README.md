# Under-The-Veil
The practice project for "Behind The Silicon Veil"

This project started as an idea in January 2023 as a fun and engaging way of gaining experience coding in C#. I started working on the project in February 2023 and it lasted until the 15th March when I decided that the learning stages near the beginning had some snowball effects on the code in terms of being hard to debug and optimize.

The game is a demonstration of my C# coding ability and "Behind The Silicon Veil" will now feature similar things from this test.

There are the full game files in the "Under-The-Veil-Unity" folder and there are the C# and art files under the "Raw-Files" folder.
